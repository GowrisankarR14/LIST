        Initially a children's game, it gradually evolved into a sport for adults by the 17<sup>th</sup> century.
         The game spread globally through the British Empire, becoming particularly popular in <b>South Asia</b>,
         <b>Australia</b>, <b>New Zealand</b>, the <b>United Kingdom</b>, <b>Southern Africa</b>, and the<b>West Indies</b> . 
    </p>

            <li>Background</li><p>England, likely in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, as a children's game. 
                It evolved from simpler bat-and-ball games and gained popularity among adults in the 17<sup>th</sup> century,
                 becoming a professional sport by the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The first recorded match was in Kent, England, 
                 and the game's laws were first created in 1744. International cricket began in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century,
                  with the first Test matches between England and Australia. </p>

                  marking significant expansion. However, issues like apartheid in South Africa and financial disputes led to temporary
